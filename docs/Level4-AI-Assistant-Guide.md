## Configuration

### Environment Variables

To enable cloud AI features, set one of the following environment variable groups:

#### Azure OpenAI (Recommended)
```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-key"
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com"
export AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4
```

#### OpenAI API (Alternative)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
```

### Fallback Mode
If no API keys are configured, the assistant automatically runs in intelligent fallback mode using local pattern matching. This mode supports all core commands but with simpler parsing.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Connection
**User Input:** `"connect to office-server.company.com as alice"`

**AI Response:** 
```
ü§ñ AssistBot: I found the server (office-server.company.com) and user (alice), 
but I need a password to connect. For security, please use the connection dialog.
```

**Action:** Opens connection dialog with pre-filled server and username

### Example 2: Advanced Command Chaining
**User Input:** `"connect to server1.production.com and server2.dev.com, then take fullscreen screenshots of both"`

**AI Response:**
```
ü§ñ AssistBot: I'll execute these commands in sequence:

üîó Step 1: Connecting to server1.production.com...
üîó Step 2: Connecting to server2.dev.com...
üîó Step 3: Taking fullscreen screenshot of server1...
üîó Step 4: Taking fullscreen screenshot of server2...

‚úÖ All commands completed successfully!
```

**Action:** Sequential execution with progress tracking

### Example 3: Smart Profile Management
**User Input:** `"save this production database connection for daily use"`

**AI Response:**
```
ü§ñ AssistBot: üíæ Created profile "Production Database - Daily Use"
- Host: prod-db.company.com:1433
- Description: Production database for daily monitoring
- Tags: production, database, daily
- Auto-generated connection preferences applied

Profile saved! Use "load production database" to quickly connect.
```

### Example 4: Context-Aware Follow-up
**User Input:** `"take a screenshot"` (after connecting to a server)

**AI Response:**
```
ü§ñ AssistBot: üì∏ Taking session screenshot of prod-server.company.com
(remembering from our previous conversation)

Screenshot captured in fullscreen mode as per your preference.
