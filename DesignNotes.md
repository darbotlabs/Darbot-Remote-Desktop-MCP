## Technology Stack

### Client Application
- **Framework**: .NET 8 (targeting future .NET 10 when available)
- **UI Framework**: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for rich desktop experience
- **Target Platforms**: Windows 10/11
- **Theme**: Custom retro-futuristic XAML resources with neon cyberpunk aesthetics

### Web API Companion
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- **Purpose**: Remote status monitoring, session management helpers, and potential cloud integration
- **Deployment**: Can be hosted locally or in cloud for distributed scenarios

### Shared Components
- **Models**: Common data structures for RDP session management
- **Utilities**: Shared business logic and helper functions
- **Configuration**: Common settings and constants

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Design - Retro Cyber Theme
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Neon Cyan (#00FFFF), Neon Magenta (#FF00FF)
  - Secondary: Neon Green (#00FF00), Neon Blue (#00BFFF), Neon Pink (#FF1493)
  - Background: Black (#000000), Dark Gray (#1A1A1A)
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts (Consolas, Monaco) for retro computing feel
- **Effects**: Neon glow effects, gradient highlights, subtle animations
- **Layout**: Dark theme with high contrast, minimal but functional interface

### User Experience
- **Conversational Interface**: ChatGPT/Copilot-style layout with sidebar navigation
- **Tabbed Sessions**: Browser-like tabs for multiple RDP connections
- **AI Integration**: Natural language commands for session management
- **Fluid Navigation**: Smooth transitions between sessions and features

## Multi-Session RDP Approach

### Session Management Strategy
1. **RDP Protocol Integration**: 
   - Evaluate MSTSC (Microsoft Terminal Services Client) integration
   - Consider third-party RDP controls (AxInterop.MSTSCLib)
   - Implement custom RDP protocol handling if needed

2. **Session Lifecycle**:
   - Connection establishment and authentication
   - Session state management (connected, disconnected, reconnecting)
   - Resource cleanup and disposal
   - Session persistence across application restarts

3. **Multi-Session Architecture**:
   - Tab-based UI similar to web browsers
   - Background session management
   - Resource optimization for multiple concurrent connections
   - Session switching with minimal latency

## AI Assistant Framework

### Agentic AI Integration
- **Natural Language Processing**: Accept commands like "Connect to server1" or "Show all active sessions"
- **Session Automation**: AI-driven connection management and troubleshooting
- **Contextual Help**: Intelligent assistance based on current session state
- **Learning Capabilities**: Adapt to user preferences and common workflows

### Microsoft AI SDK Integration
- Leverage Microsoft Cognitive Services
- Integration with Azure OpenAI Service
- On-device AI capabilities where appropriate
- Privacy-first approach for sensitive RDP credentials

## Security Considerations

### RDP Security
- Encrypted credential storage
- Certificate validation for RDP connections
- Network security best practices
- Session isolation and sandboxing

### Code Security
- CodeQL static analysis in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding practices enforcement
- Regular security audits

## Development Workflow

### Continuous Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build, test, and deployment
- **Multi-platform Testing**: Windows and cross-platform where applicable
- **Code Quality**: Static analysis, linting, and formatting checks
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for RDP functionality
- UI automation tests for key workflows
- Performance testing for multi-session scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Level 2+ Features (Planned)
- Advanced UI components and animations
- RDP session recording and playback
- Cloud synchronization of connection profiles
- Advanced AI features and automation
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Mobile companion app integration

### Performance Optimizations
- Resource pooling for RDP connections
- Efficient memory management for multiple sessions
- GPU acceleration for rendering where possible
- Network optimization for low-bandwidth scenarios

## Compliance and Standards

### Microsoft Design Guidelines
- Windows 11 Fluent Design principles
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)
- Windows Store app guidelines (future consideration)
- Microsoft security and privacy standards

### Development Standards
- .NET coding conventions
- MVVM architectural pattern for WPF
- RESTful API design for web services
- Git workflow with feature branches and pull requests
